However, this beneficial composite action could be weakened even destroyed by debonding, which is almost unavoidable as a common phenomenon in CFST structures and has not been considered satisfactorily by current design codes. In this paper, the influence of debonding on circular CFST stub columns was investigated experimentally and numerically. The main experimental parameters were the debonding arc-length ratio, the confinement factor and the load mode. Meanwhile, the finite element models were implemented using the ABAQUS finite element software, of which the validity and accuracy were verified by test results. Utilising the finite element model, the parametric analysis was carried out to study the influence of the following parameters on the ultimate load capacity of debonding specimens: debonding arc-length ratio, debonding thickness and confinement factor. Based on the results of parametric analysis, a simplified calculation formula was proposed to calculate the ultimate load capacity of circular CFST stub columns with debonding. "

The compressive strength of the core concrete can be increased by reason of the lateral confinement provided by the steel tube, and the local buckling of steel tube can be delayed and restrained by the concrete filled [1–3]. This beneficial composite action requires force transfer between the steel tube and the core concrete, while debonding will have unfavourable effect on the confinement.

The finite element models of experimental specimens were implemented by ABAQUS, of which the validity and accuracy were verified by test results. Then, utilising the finite element model, the parametric analysis was conducted to study the influence of different parameters on the ultimate load capacity of circular CFST stub columns with debonding. Finally, based on the results of parametric analysis, a simplified calculation formula was proposed to calculate the influence of debonding on the ultimate load capacity of circular CFST stub columns.

Therefore, for the surfaces of both materials in debonding area, only the contact pressure model in the normal direction was used. However, for the surfaces of both materials without debonding, the steel–concrete interaction with a contact pressure model in the normal direction and a Coulomb friction modelling in the tangential direction with the frictional factor was used. According to the Coulomb friction model, the surfaces can transfer the shear stress until the shear stress is greater than the limit value [14]. The limit value depends on the confinement stress "

When debonding arc-length ratio or debonding thickness is less than a critical value, the reduction coefficient of ultimate load capacity decreases fast. On the contrary, the reduction coefficient of ultimate load capacity decreases slowly. Moreover, with the increase of the confinement factor, the critical value of debonding thickness increases. "
