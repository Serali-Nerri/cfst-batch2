Current design codes place limits on the strengths of steel and concrete due to limited test data and experience on the behaviour of composite members with the high strength materials. To extend their applications, a comprehensive experimental program has been carried out to investigate the behaviour of concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) with highand ultra-high- strength materials at ambient temperature. This article presented some new findings on the axial performance of 56 short CFSTs. High tensile steel with yield strength up to 780 MPa and ultrahigh strength concrete with compressive cylinder strength up to 190 MPa were used to prepare the CFST test specimens. The key issue is to clarify if the plastic cross-sectional resistance could be used at ultimate limit state as for CFSTs with the normal strength materials. To address this, experimental and analytical methods were adopted where the test results were compared with the predictions by various design codes world widely, and design recommendations were therefore proposed so that the prediction methods could be safely extended to the short CFSTs with the high- and ultra-high- strength materials.

Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs), one of the most widely used composite members in high-rise construction in Asia, take the full advantages of the characteristic behaviour of steel and concrete materials. It is well known that the core concrete delays the local buckling and temperature rise of steel tube and in turn enhances the strength and ductility of core concrete. Moreover, the steel tube eliminates the need of formwork for concrete casting and thus leads to fast track construction. The CFSTs have various types of cross-section. Circular, square and rectangular sections are generally used whereas elliptical and polygonal sections could be adopted catering for architectural aesthetics or functional requirements. Conventionally, only plain concrete is infilled to the hollow tubes. Nowadays, the concrete may be reinforced by polymer or steel fibers to enhance ductility "

Reinforcing steel cages are mainly used to improve the fire resistance, since the steel cages are capable to take over loads when the external tube is sacrificed under fire. For convenience, the steel cage could be replaced by an internal tube to improve the fire resistance as well as the compressive resistance and ductility due to higher confinement provided. Other steel sections, such as solid steel sections or H-sections, can be inserted into the core concrete to further improve the compressive resistance and thus reduce the member size. Nevertheless, the steel cages, internal tubes and inserted sections are less used in practice due to some incurred construction difficulties, such as congesting the concrete casting area and obstructing the inner diaphragm plates at beam-column joints, etc. "

Therefore, more investigations should be carried out to assess their potential applications in high-rise construction. This paper presented the test data and code predictions on the short CFSTs under concentric compression to evaluate the cross-sectional resistance. Design recommendations were then proposed for the relevant design approaches. It should be mentioned that this is a supplementary and summary work to the preliminary and incomplete research introduced in Ref.[14].

It seemed that the said load drop was larger for the circular single-tube CFST (C18) than the square CFST (S4), the doubletube CFSTs (DC9 & DS2) were in like manner.

As a result, the axial stiffness was reduced where the slopes of the load-displacement curves became smaller.

As a result, the compressive strength of the UHSC in C1 should be increased more than that in C2. This explains why the ultimate resistance of C1 was higher than that of C2, although they were identical specimens. The interfacial slips, in other words, the bonding resistance were different between C1 and C2, this could be caused by different surface conditions, for instance, the rust conditions might be different. In practice, there are CFST columns with discontinuous steel tubes at the beam-column connections (floor beams are continuous), thus the beam reaction forces are exactly transferred to the core concrete only. Under such circumstances, proper measures could be taken to decrease the bonding resistance and then to increase the ultimate resistance of the CFST columns. This is favourable for the design at ultimate limit state. However, there is an adverse effect as the axial stiffness will be reduced, this is unfavourable for the design at serviceability limit state. Hence the bonding resistance "

Similarly, for UHSC, the interface zones are further denser and stronger. The ordinary granite coarse aggregates are weak links and thus the cracks propagated through the aggregates as shown in Fig. 13. In such cases, high strength coarse aggregates are recommended to be used in the UHSC. "

The compressive resistance can be further higher if both the UHSC and HTS are used. The ductility performance of the CFST columns with the UHSC should be considered, due to the brittleness of the UHSC. The ductility can be improved if: (1) the compression load is applied only on the UHSC core; (2) double-tube scheme is properly adopted; (3) Class 1 steel sections are used; (4) or the higher steel contribution ratio is adopted.
