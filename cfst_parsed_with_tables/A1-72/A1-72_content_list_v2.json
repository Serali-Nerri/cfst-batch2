Secondly, an extensive numerical study accounting for the confinement effect, as well as the non-linearities of materials, geometry and contacts was performed. Upon validation against the test results, a parametric investigation was conducted. A wide range of the cross-section dimensions and section slenderness of CFHSS circular tubular sections inflated with different grades of concrete were considered. The structural behaviour of concrete-filled CFHSS stub columns was investigated, including the ultimate load, end shortening, strength enhancement index and ductility index. Finally, the experimental and numerical results were used to assess the suitability of the design equations specified in the existing American Specifications (AISC and ACI), European Code (EC4) and Japanese Code (AIJ) for the compressive strength of the concrete-filled CFHSS circular stub columns. It was found that the predictions from the existing international design specifications were generally conservative, except for EC4. The predictions by the AIJ are the least conservative and least scattered. However, by using the effective section area of steel tubes for slender cross sections, EC4 provided the most accurate and consistent predictions than the other design specifications. "

They have been used as mega columns in super high-rise buildings, chord members in long-span composite bridges, piles in floodwall structures, bridge piers and transmission towers [1]. The applications could be further extended in submarine pipeline structures, as show in the recent works by Wang et al. [2] and Wang and Han [3]. Their excellent structural performance is mainly benefited from the interactions between the inner concrete and outer steel tube, for example, the steel tube provides confinement to the infilled concrete while the infilled concrete prevents the inward buckling and delays the local buckling of the steel tube [4]. These contribute to the structural behaviour of the concrete-filled members, e.g., increased bearing "

Commonly, there are two methods for increasing the resistance of concrete-filled steel columns [1]. The first method is by increasing the "

Previous investigations [35] have shown that a friction coefficient from 0.1 to 0.5 generally causes limited effect on the prediction of the ultimate strength, but a smaller friction factor may induce a convergent problem with large deformation. It should be noted that different friction coefficients have been used in literature, for examples, coefficients of 0.25 [36], 0.3 [37] and 0.6 [38]. In the present study, the friction factor of 0.25 in the tangential direction between the concrete and steel was used, while the \"hard contact\" behaviour in the normal direction was assumed with no penetration allowed between the surfaces.

The reference node was coupled with the corresponding cross-section at each column end in displacements and rotations. Hence, the boundary conditions of each stub column were associated with the reference nodes at both ends. The reference nodes were restrained against all degrees of freedom, except for the longitudinal displacement (along the length direction of the stub column) at the loading point. A typical assembled specimen with the reference nodes coupled with the cross-section ends is shown in Fig. 4(c). A specified axial displacement was assigned to the reference node at the loading point. General Static analysis step was adopted. Hence, the adopted displacement control method in the tests was simulated in the FEM analyses. The nonlinear geometric parameter (NLGEOM) was enabled to deal with the large displacement analysis. "

The compressive resistance of concrete-filled steel columns given in EC4 [29] accounts for not only the beneficial confining effect of the steel tube on the concrete, but also the corresponding reduction to the strength of the steel tube caused by those circumferential stresses arising from the restriction of the lateral expansion of the concrete.

The ultimate loads, failure modes and full load-end shortening curves of these CFHSS circular stub columns have been presented in this paper. An extensive numerical study accounting for the confinement effect, as well as the non-linearities of materials, geometry and contacts have also been performed by using a validated finite element model. The behaviour of CFHSS circular stub columns has been investigated, including the ultimate load, the end shortening, the strength enhancement index and the ductility index. Finally, experimental and numerical results have been used to assess the suitability of the design equations specified in the current international specification, including American Specifications (AISC and ACI), European Code (EC4) and Japanese Code (AIJ) for the cross-section strength of CFHSS stub columns. Findings from the present study are summarized below: "
