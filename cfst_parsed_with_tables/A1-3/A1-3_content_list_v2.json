Seventeen specimens were tested to examine the effects of cross-sectional shapes, width-to-thickness ratios, and stiffening arrangements on the ultimate strength, stiffness, and ductility of CFT columns. Moreover, nonlinear finite element analysis was also conducted to investigate cross-sectional axial stress distribution at the ultimate strength. Comparing the measured ultimate strength with estimates by using some current specifications suggested that current specifications may considerably underestimate the ultimate strength of circular CFT columns, particularly for columns with a small width-to-thickness ratio. Results in this study demonstrate that the proposed stiffening scheme can significantly enhance the ultimate strength and ductility of square CFT columns. "

CFT columns have become so widespread owing to their axially compressed nature making them superior to conventional reinforced concrete and steel structural systems in terms of stiffness, strength, ductility, and energy absorption capacity. The steel tube not only takes axial load, but also provides confining pressure to the concrete core, while the concrete core takes axial load and prevents or delays local buckling of the steel tube. Furthermore, concrete-filled composite columns also have the advantage of requiring no formwork during construction, thus reducing construction costs. "

Since the early 1960s, researchers in China have systematically and comprehensively investigated the behavior of circular CFT columns through laboratory tests and numerical analyses, and Zhong's book summarizes some of the results (Zhong 1995). These early works revealed that a square concrete-filled steel tube does not perform as well as a circular one because a square steel tube provides less confining pressure, making local buckling more likely. This fact is reflected in modern design codes such as Manual of Steel Construction: Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) by American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC 1994; 1997) and Recommendations for Design and Construction of Concrete-Filled Steel Tubular Structures by Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ 1997), in which the limiting width-to-thickness ratio of a steel "

The yield strength was determined from tests on tensile coupons taken from the steel plates that were also used to form the steel tubes. The size of coupons and the test procedures follow American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM E10-84 (ASTM 1991) requirements. The square tubes were constructed by seam welding two U-shaped cold-formed steel plates. If stiffening were specified, the tie bars were fillet welded to the U-shaped cold-formed steel plates (see Fig. 1) before making the seam complete penetration groove welds (see Fig. 1). The typical layout of the tie bars is also shown in Fig. 1. Notably, a CFT constructed by seam welding four pieces of steel plates is likely to fail in the seam weld when tested because of stress concentration at the corners (Lin and Huang 1989). "
