Tests on steel tubular columns of square, rectangular and circular section filled with normal and lightweight aggregate concrete were conducted to investigate the failure modes of such composite columns. Thirty-six full scale columns filled with lightweight and normal weight aggregate concrete, eighteen specimens for each, were tested under axial loads. Nine hollow steel sections of similar specimens were also tested and results were compared to those of filled sections. The test results were illustrated by a number of load-deflection and axial deformation curves. The results showed that both types of filled columns failed due to overall buckling, while hollow steel columns failed due to bulging at their ends (local buckling). According to the above-mentioned results, and due to low specific gravity and thermal conductivity of the lightweight concrete the further interest should be concentrated in replacing the normal concrete by the lightweight aggregate concrete.

From the other hand the use of lightweight concrete in composite structures, if permitted, is restricted by a specified limit of strength. However, thermal conductivity of lightweight concrete, as well as the low specific gravity that produces lighter structures, seems to be good reasons for using lightweight concrete in composite construction. Several investigations carried by Ramamurthy, Srinivasan, Salani and Sims, Chapman and Neogi, Gardner and Jacobson (1978) in order to study the behavior of short and long columns filled with normal concrete. The results of the tests on short concrete-filled steel tubular columns were used to determine the tangent modulus-buckling load of longer columns. Hunaiti (1997), conducted an experimental study on steel hollow tubes of square and circular section filled with foamed and lightweight aggregate concrete, and the conclusion was that the foamed concrete-filled column specimens were incapable of reaching the predicted values of the squash load, while column specimens filled with lightweight aggregate concrete developed the ultimate axial capacity and the lightweight concrete enhances the strength of the steel section. Brauns (1998) conducted a stress analysis for concrete-filled steel tubular column. His recommendation was summarized in the following conclusion: In order to prevent the possibility of column failure in the case of small steel thickness, large eccentricities and suitable steel strengths have to be used.

Columns filled with lightweight aggregate concrete exhibited local buckling, and when the column reached failure load an overall buckling took place. Nevertheless, such negative effect (the local buckling) did not significantly reduce the load carrying capacity of the column. However columns with normal concrete exhibited overall buckling with no signs of local buckling prior to failure. It can be seen from the results of comparisons between different types of columns and different dimensions, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, that columns filled with lightweight concrete exhibit more lateral deflection and more axial deformation than hollow steel columns. Higher deflection reflects higher ductility. "
