The benefits of CFST structures can be further achieved if high-strength materials are used. However, when high-strength steel is applied to CFST structures, the thin-walled steel section may not develop its yield strength owing to the early crushing of the cover concrete. Therefore, this paper presents an experimental study on concrete-filled circular high-strength steel stub tube (CFHST) focusing on the effect of the diameter-to-thickness (D/t) ratio. Fifteen specimens were tested under axial compression, with D/t ratios ranging from 50 to 130. The effects of the D/t ratio on the failure mode, loadversus-deformation relationship, and axial compression strength were investigated. Test results showed that the CFHST with a large D/t ratio can still reach the plastic section design. The fibre element method proposed by Liang et al. was revised to predict the load-axial deformation curves and then validated by using the ultimate bearing strength of CFST columns from 215 collected data. Finally, the bearing capacity of CFHST columns was compared with the present design codes, namely, Eurocode 4, American Institute of Steel Construction standard (AISC 360-10), Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ) standard, and the proposed model, to evaluate the feasibility of the current codes for predicting the axial compressive strength of CFHST under axial compression.

The enhancement is due to the composite action between the individual elements. On the one hand, the concrete infill can prevent local buckling of the steel tube. On the other hand, the concrete confined by the steel tube is in a tri-axial compression stress state, which leads to higher loading-carrying capacity.

First, an experimental program is introduced to study the behaviour of CFHST columns with different D/t ratios in Sections 2 and 3. Then, a fibre element model is adopted and revised to predict the behaviour of CFHST and then verified against the test results and collected data in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, the validity of current design codes for predicting the axial bearing strength of CFHST columns under axial compression is evaluated in Section 6. "

With the increase in axial load, shear failure occurred at the middle or end of the steel tube. Some differences happened at the moment owing to the D/t ratio. As for specimen with a smaller D/t ratio, for instance, C140-1, the confinement factor was enough for the axial load to transfer and the second shear failure surface could occur. However, as for specimen with a larger D/t ratio, the axial load could not be transferred and only the first shear failure surface was broadened.

One is to take the axial strain as the average reading from the average midheight axial strain gauges, and the other is to take the overall axial shortening divided by the specimen length. When the deformation of the end plates is considered, the shortening is always larger than the mid-height strain. Therefore, readings from the axial strain gauges could be taken to closely reflect the strain state of the steel tube at the mid-height, as employed by Hu et al. [24]. During the test, significant slips existed after the development of local buckling of the steel tube, as observed in the experimental test, which means that the axial strain gauge readings cannot be assumed to closely reflect the strain state of the confined concrete after local buckling, according to Hu et al. [24]. Therefore, these axial strain gauge readings applied in the analysis of the stress state of the steel tube in the present study were adopted before local buckling. The load-average longitudinal strain and lateral strain curves of the specimens were plotted and are shown in Fig. 10, except for C150-1 owing to data acquisition mistake. "

Whether or not the current codes could accurately predict the behaviour of CFHST with a large D/t ratio remains a question. In this section, the experimental results were employed to calibrate the provisions in the design codes (EC4, AISC 360–10, and AIJ), the Liang et al.‘s model, and the proposed model for the design of high-strength composite columns with a large D/t ratio.
