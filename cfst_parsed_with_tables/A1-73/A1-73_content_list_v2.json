The proposed technique involved the strengthening of CFST columns using high-strength carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) textile grid-reinforced high-ductility engineered cementitious composite (ECC). The behaviour of composite columns under axial compression was investigated. A total of 30 specimens, which comprised 27 strengthened columns and three un-strengthened control specimens, were subjected to experimental tests. The parameters considered for the tests were the number of CFRP textile grid layers, diameter–thickness ratio, and concrete strength. The experimental results showed that strengthened specimens exhibited a better strengthening effect than the control specimens. Unlike brittle failure, which occurred when the CFST columns were strengthened with FRP sheets, the ductility of the columns strengthened with CFRP textile grid-reinforced ECC was as good as that of CFSTs because of the occurrence of progressive failure. The in-filled concrete, whose strength increased owing to the confinement of the CFRP textile grids, resisted most of the loads on the strengthened columns. Based on different models, equations were derived to predict the load-bearing capacity, and the predicted results showed high accuracy. "

[5,6] were the first to develop confining CFST structures using the FRP, which were identified as confined concrete-filled tubular structures. Several studies based on their work have been conducted recently. It has been reported that the outward buckling of a steel tube can be delayed using FRP wraps. The additional confinement provided to the concrete core can increase the strength of the structure [7– 11]. The number of FRP layers adopted has a significant effect on the behaviour of the columns.

Some researchers applied an inorganic matrix as an alternative adhesive to organic epoxy resins to overcome these problems [16]. Widely applied inorganic matrix adhesives include magnesium phosphate cement, magnesium oxychloride cement, and geopolymer cement [17]. Most inorganic matrix adhesives offer advantages, such as high-temperature functionality and excellent corrosion resistance. The application of an inorganic matrix to the FRP strengthening technique can solve the strength degradation problem when organic epoxy resins are exposed to high temperatures, adverse environments, or both. However, when combined with FRP sheets, the penetration and impregnation efficiencies of inorganic matrices are lower than those of organic epoxy resins, which create an unsatisfactory strengthening effect. Thus, continuous-fibre sheets are typically replaced with textile grids. The new composites are called textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) or textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) [18]. TRC has been extensively used in structural retrofitting, particularly for the strengthening of concrete and masonry [19–25]. A problem associated with the use of TRC strengthening layers is that the ultimate strain of the inorganic matrix is generally lower than that of FRP textile grids. Inorganic matrix cracks develop before the FRP attains its ultimate strain, which leads to stress concentration in the FRP textile grids and induces the premature failure of the TRC. Moreover, the wide premature cracks can create a free passage for harmful substances to penetrate the structure; this accelerates the deterioration of the structure. "

Because of the combination of the excellent ductility and durability of ECCs with the high strength of FRPs, FRP textile grid-reinforced ECCs show potential in the structural strengthening of composites. Basalt fabric-reinforced ECC systems have been successfully applied in the repair of fire-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) slabs [30]. In their study, Gao et al. [30] used two types of cementitious matrix, i.e. ECC and a polymer-modified mortar (PMM). The test results indicated that ECCs were superior to PMMs in the strengthening system owing to their enhanced deformation, energy dissipation, and load-bearing capacity. It has been proven that the flexural behaviour is significantly improved in retrofitted RC beams [31]. ECCs exhibit a more ductile failure than epoxy mortar, mainly because of the multiple cracking behaviours of ECCs. Debonding of the strengthening layer occurs when high-strength and stiffness-reinforcing materials are embedded in the ECC. Thus, a reliable anchorage technique is required to prevent debonding failure [32]. Al-Gemeel et al. [33,34] investigated the axial performance of square and circular concrete columns confined using basalt textile grid-reinforced ECC. A cross-section of a square concrete column was converted to a circular section by casting the strengthening layer to maximise the confining effect. No debonding failure between the original concrete and strengthening layer was observed, and both the load-bearing capacity and ductility improved significantly. The test results also indicated that plain ECC (e.g. without a basalt textile grid) could be used as a strengthening layer, owing to the favourable strengthening effect. "

In this study, a novel composite structure, i.e. CFST columns strengthened with high-strength CFRP textile grid-reinforced high-ductility ECC, was developed. On the one hand, the CFRP was expected to provide additional confinement for the concrete core because of its high strength; on the other hand, the ECC was expected to act as a high-ductility adhesive, owing to its multiple cracking characteristics. Furthermore, the fire resistance and corrosion resistance of CFSTs could be enhanced owing to the ECC cover. This study focussed on the axial behaviour of CFST columns strengthened with high-strength CFRP textile grid-reinforced high-ductility ECC. The failure modes, load–deformation response, load-bearing capacities, ductility, and confining effects of the CFRP textile grid were analysed. Models were developed to predict the load-bearing capacities of the strengthened columns. "

With a decrease in the applied load, a visible wide diagonal crack was observed. The integrity of the strengthening layer was maintained during the loading process, i.e. no debonding failure of the strengthening layer occurred. After the coat was removed on completion of the tests, a shear line connected by the bulges was observed on the steel tube surface. On removal of the steel tube, a shear plane could be observed in the concrete core. Fig. 9(a)–(c) show the failure of the components of Specimen N2-t2-C30; Fig. 9(d)–(f) correspond to those of N2-t3- C50. A comparison between the failure of these specimens shows that the shear plane in the concrete core, shear bulge line in the steel tube, and diagonal crack in the strengthening layer appeared at the same location. Thus, it can be inferred that the failure mode of the strengthened column was dominated by the failure mode of the original CFST. The shear failure of the CFST remained unchanged after strengthening, and the failure mode of the strengthening layer was closely related to that of the original CFST. "

Under confinement, the load-bearing capacity of the column improved, and the deformation capacity increased slightly (Point B versus Point D). In the last phase, the applied load gently decreased with the progressive rupturing of the fibre filaments. For the FRP sheet strengthening system, hardening occurred beyond Point E (the same axial shortening as that of Point B). Finally, brittle failure occurred at significant axial shortening owing to the rupture of the FRP sheets. The above analysis indicated that the performance of the CFST columns strengthened using CFRP textile gridreinforced ECC was quite different from that strengthened using FRP sheets (the ultimate strain was significantly lower than that "

This closeness was attributed to the fact that the Poisson’s ratio of the in-filled concrete was lower than that of the steel tube. In this case, the interaction between the two components under axial loading was negligible, and the lateral deformation of the steel tube was unaffected by concrete. For the strengthening layer, the value was assumed to be approximately equal to that of the matrix (ECC) according to previous studies [22,36] because it is difficult to measure the strain of the CFRP textile. From the curves, it was observed that the evolution trend for the lateral deformation of the CFRP textile was similar to that of the steel tube, and their "

However, it was found that some specimens with two or three layers of CFRP exhibited higher ductility than specimens with one layer. The reason for this contrary result can be explained by the fact that in the strengthening layer, different layers of CFRP textiles were separate in the ECC. Because it was difficult to guaranty that all the layers of textile were wholly stretched during construction, stresses were unevenly distributed among different textile layers during loading, and textile rovings in different layers did not rupture simultaneously. When the first layer of textile ruptured, the load started to decrease, and the second or third layer still functioned as a load-bearing part until all the textiles ruptured. This behaviour occurred more frequently when additional layers of textiles were (Fig. 16(a)). Except for three points, the increasing ratios when "
