Under axial compression, the steel tube is subjected to biaxial stress state in the hoop and axial direction, and the hoop stress component provides confinement for the inner concrete. However, the existence of axial stress component accelerates the buckling of steel tube, which hinders its confinement effect to inner concrete and accordingly column's axial compressive strength and ductility. This paper aims to enhance the axial compressive strength and ductility of CFST stub columns by improving its confinement effect provided by the steel tube. CFST stub columns axially loaded/unloaded were experimentally studied for different cases: a) varying concrete strength, b) lubrication on the contact between steel tube and concrete and c) corrugations in the steel tube that are introduced to intentionally weaken the tube vertically. It was found that axial compressive strength of CFST stub columns was effectively enhanced by reducing the axial stress in the steel tube. The introduction of corrugations in the steel tube led to largely concentrated axial deformation which reduced axial stress in other portions of the steel tube and consequently resulted in “tighter” hoop confinement to the inner concrete; both axial compressive strength and ductility were enhanced.

In CFST columns, steel tube confines the inner concrete, which effectively enhances the axial load bearing capacity of concrete; inner concrete provides partial support for steel tube and thus prevents or at least delays the local buckling of steel tube. Moreover, the steel tube functions as the permanent formwork in casting the inner concrete, which saves material cost and construction time. Of interest in this study are the CFST stub columns using circular steel tubes, which are considered more effective in offering post-yield strength and stiffness than those with square or rectangular cross sections [1]. There are extensive experimental studies available on circular CFST columns, with primary research focuses on tube diameter-to-thickness ratio [2–6], concrete strength [7–9] or bond behavior between steel tube and concrete [10–13].

                        "content": "initial elastic stage under compression, there is no composite action due to the different dilation of steel tube and concrete. To be more specific, the steel tube expands faster in the radial direction than the concrete core because the Poisson's ratio for steel is larger than that for concrete. With the increase of axial compression, the compressed concrete starts to plasticize, the lateral expansion of the concrete catch up with that of the tube and confinement effect initiates [14]. After micro cracks in the concrete propagate and the steel tube enters into the inelastic outward buckling, the efficiency of composite action degrades. To improve the composite action, various types of external confinement were proposed, such as installment of steel rings [15], ties [16], spirals [17], jackets [18], or FRP wraps [19–23]. With all these added external confinements, the composite action was improved to varying extent. However, it is worth mentioning that the improved composite action was provided by the added strips/layers, not by the steel tube itself. Under axial compression, the steel tube can be assumed to be in biaxial plane stress state, in axial and hoop stress state, where the hoop stress component provides the confinement to the inner concrete. The overall axial capacity of CFST columns may be enhanced if the confinement provided by hoop stress in the steel tube itself can be increased somehow, even without needing external confinement. To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no literature available yet regarding enhancing axial capacity of CFST columns through increasing the confinement provided by the steel tube itself. "

The inside surface of steel tubes in Group 2 was lubricated with grease prior to the casting of the inner concrete, to eliminate the friction between steel tube and inner concrete. Details of the corrugation in Group 3 will be described later. Three coupons were randomly cut from the steel tube and were tested according to standard procedures [27].

The other three pairs of specimens, with confinement coefficients of 0.81, 0.61, and 0.43 respectively, showed softened load-deformation curves, with notable post-peak axial strength decrease (Fig. 4b–d). It is reasonable to infer that a confinement coefficient of about unity would give load-deformation curves with no strength decrease, which is consistent with the previous findings by Johansson [29].

Specimens SC-52-1 with one corrugation and SC-52-2 with two corrugations behaved similarly: the axial strain in the steel tube was nearly the same, and the strain almost doubled at the corrugation. With much larger compressive deformation concentrated at corrugations, the axial strain in the steel tube was effectively reduced.
