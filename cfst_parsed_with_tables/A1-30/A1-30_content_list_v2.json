However, prior to infilling of concrete, the steel tubes are subjected to preloads from upper floors arising from construction loads and permanent loads of the building. These preloads cause initial stresses and deformations in the steel tubes which would affect the load carrying capacity of the composite columns. In this paper, a design method based on a modified Eurocode 4 approach, incorporating the effect of preload, is proposed to evaluate the axial capacity of concrete filled composite columns. Eight full-scale composite column specimens were tested. Parameters studied included the strength of the concrete infill, slenderness of the columns and the amount of preload applied on the steel tubes. Results obtained from the proposed method are compared against test results and other published data. Comparison studies show that the test results are on average "

Steel tubes serve as permanent formwork for multistorey construction in which concrete may be pumped upwards from the base or cast downwards from the top of the columns. Therefore, CFST are becoming popular for high rise construction [3–10]. "

CFT-S-40-30P showed lower strength but better ductility because lower strength concrete was used and stronger concrete confinement was provided by steel tube to the concrete core. The failure of CFT-S-40-30P was initiated by yielding of the steel tube, and later the load was resisted by the concrete until it was crushed at the ultimate load. A distinct bulging of the steel casing was observed for CFT-S-30-30P at the post-ultimate load range as shown in Fig. 8. However, no such bulging was observed for CFT-S-100-30P; instead, a loud cracking noise emanating from the specimen was heard just before the ultimate load was achieved, and this was followed by a shape drop in load. This phenomenon was due to a sudden failure of the high strength concrete inside the tube causing a dip in hydraulic pressure supplied to the actuator. After the unloading process was completed, redistribution within the concrete matrix enabled a slight increase in the load applied but this was less than the first peak load observed earlier. "
