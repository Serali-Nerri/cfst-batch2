The loading conditions examined include axial loading of the steel only, axial loading of the concrete only, and simultaneous loading of the concrete and steel both axially and at small eccentricities. Recent tests on circular concrete filled steel tubes have been used to calibrate and validate the proposed design methods. The test specimens were short with a length-to-diameter ratio of 3.5 and a diameter thickness ratio between 60 and 220. The internal concrete had nominal unconfined cylinder strengths of 50, 80, and  "

These two methods are quite different in concept. Eurocode 4 (CEN 1992) uses a column curve to determine the influence of slenderness (similar to most modern steel codes). Additionally, enhancement of the concrete from confinement is included for some specific cases. The ACI 318 (ACI 1989) method used the traditional reinforced concrete approach, similar to AS3600 [Standards Association of Australia (SAA) 1994] with a minimum load eccentricity used to determine the column strength under nominal axial load. Bridge (1990) proposed a variation on the reinforced concrete approach, similar to the method in AS3600 (AS 1994). "

A local buckle was observed in specimen S10CS80B with a very small half-wavelength, similar to that observed by O'Shea and Bridge (1997c) for identical steel tubes with unbonded internal concrete restraint. Consequently, slip between the steel and the concrete must have occurred for specimen S10CS80B. Although large plastic deformations occurred in the steel tube in the locally buckled region, beyond this region the steel tube elastically unloads with a reduction in the vertical stress (compressive). This allowed greater circumferential stress (tensile) to be applied to the steel tube prior to the steel yield failure surface being reached, providing additional restraint to the internal concrete. As a result, the test was similar to the concrete loaded test with unbonded concrete with a corresponding higher load. This is in contrast to the results from specimens S16CS10A and S10CS10A. Although both of these specimens buckled, locally significant improvements in strength did not occur, indicating that little confinement can be achieved for very-high-strength concrete (unconfined strengths above  "

As discussed in O'Shea and Bridge (1997c), this tube was produced by cold forming (compared with cold rolling for all of the other specimens) and had a rounded stress-strain curve with a high yield stress. Further analysis and possible experimental work needs to be conducted to evaluate the influence of these effects. Despite this, Eurocode 4 (CEN 1992) provides a good estimate of the ultimate strength with an average test to predicted a ratio of 0.99. However, for specimens filled with nominal 100-MPa concrete, Eurocode (CEN 1992) consistently overestimates the confined concrete strength. "

The Australian and American standards use a similar methodology that excludes the influence of concrete confinement by the steel tube and accounts for column slenderness by a minimum eccentricity. A more rational approach was adopted by Eurocode 4 (CEN 1992), which accounts for concrete confinement for certain specimen geometries, loading conditions, and column slenderness with a column curve. It was found that Eurocode 4 (CEN 1992) provided the best estimate of the specimens strength for axial compression and combined compression and bending.
