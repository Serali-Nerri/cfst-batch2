Finally, adescription ofthe coupled behaviourofjoints as partofcomplete structures is presented,describing previous work and investigations on real fire (including heating and cooling phases)currently being carried out by the authors.

This approach was supported by the argument of the increased massivity of the joint area. However, observations from real fires show that, on several "

The observed failure modes depended on the connection type: in group 1, localized deformation at the top of the end-plate was observed, particularly around the top bolt, accompanied by deformation of the column flange and buckling of the column web. In group 2 localized deformations occurred at the top of the end-plate, slipping of the top bolts in the tension zone (maybe due softening of the bolts at elevated temperatures); at high moment levels, cracking of the end-plate along the welds was observed in both the beam web and flange. In group 3 significant end-plate deformation was developed. In groups 4 and 5 failure in the concrete slab (due to separation of the shear stubs from the concrete slab) was observed. After failure of the concrete slab, the applied load was transferred to the connection and end-plate failure was observed. In general, all high temperature tests produced failure modes similar to those of the same connections at room temperature. "

However, in addition to the structural members a complete structure also includes floor slabs, walls and others non-structural members. A proper understanding of the behaviour of a complete building in fire can only be obtained if all such components are included. Although extremely expensive, fire tests on complete buildings are essential, complemented with the investigation of accidental fire events in buildings. Crucial to the understanding of the structural behaviour of a complete building in a real fire are the Broadgate fire accident (SCI, 1991) and the Cardington fullscale fire tests (Armer  1994, Bailey  . 1999, Wang 2002). Others tests and real fires included the William street fire tests by BHP (Thomas  . 1992) and the Collin street fire test by BHP (Proe and Bennetts 1994) in Australia, the Basingstoke fire accident and the Churchill Plaza fire accident in the United Kingdom, the fire tests performed in Germany (Anon 1986) and the fire event at the World Trade Center, NY (Usmani  . 2003, Quintiere  . 2002). In the following paragraph, the Cardington full-scale fire tests will be described in more detail. "

In the demonstration test (sixth test), unlike in the previous tests, real furniture (desks, chairs, filling cabinets, computer terminals, etc.) was used for the fire load. The ventilation was provided by windows and blank openings. The beams were unprotected while the columns were protected. This test was characterized by a rapid rise in temperature representing a severe fire scenario. "

He developed a modified form of the Ramberg-Osgood equation (Ramberg and Osgood 1943) to describe the moment-rotation characteristics (El-Rimawi 1989). This relationship is defined by a single non-linear equation that always yields a positive slope, corresponding to the rotational stiffness of the joint, Eq. (1): "

However, high temperature component models are rare, due to the lack of experimental data that describes the connection behaviour. The first author to use a component model at high temperatures was Leston-Jones (1997), to predict the response of steel and composite flush end-plate joints. Comparison with experimental results (Leston-Jones 1997, Leston-Jones  1997) showed that there was good agreement for steel flush end-plate connections. However, the composite model showed a significant difference in the rate of degradation compared with experimental results. "

The high temperature effect is incorporated in each element at a given bolt-row (Fig. 11). This method is valid up to the point at which the bottom flange of the beam comes into contact with the column (Al-Jabri 1999, 2003, 2004).

The resistance of the compression zone at high temperatures was based on the room temperature approach applying the strength reduction factors in EN1993-1-2. The room temperature approach used in this study was chosen by statistical comparison of the design approaches (Block  . 2004a): "

Then a reduction of internal forces took place, probably resulting from the bending deformation of the beam induced by the axial restraint and the initial deformation. This is followed by the development of catenary action for the case of high axial restraint, as clearly observed in Fig. 15(b). In the case of an ISO834 fire (continuous temperature increase) this eventually leads to numerical instability reflecting the reduction of the yield stress of steel below values that ensure equilibrium (strength based failure criteria). In contrast, for the real fire curve, complete reversal of the bending moment distribution is observed as the temperature decreases, thus allowing an increase of the axial force as the steel properties recover. Repeating the same analysis with a parametric variation of the rotation restraint at the beam end A reveals the same qualitative behaviour, the failure temperature slowly increasing with increased joint rotational restraint (Santiago  . 2003).
