This paper presents an experimental study on the behavior of short concrete filled steel tubular columns (CFT) axially loaded in compression to failure. A total of 28 specimens (16 were filled with concrete and 12 were kept hollow) with different cross-sections were tested to investigate the load capacity. The length-to-diameter ratios of these columns were between 4 and 9. Parameters for the tests were tube shape and diameter-to-thickness ratio. Some of the concrete filled columns had internal bracing of #3 deformed bars. The test results are compared with the theoretical results and previous studies. The results show that the confinement effect on concrete does play a role in increasing the compressive strengths to almost "

At the same time, concrete is stressed tri-axially. Concrete filled tubular columns have long been used in buildings and bridges, and research had been reported in China on such since the 1970s. CFT has become popular as structural members in buildings due to their excellent structural performance characteristics, which include high strength, stiffness, and high ductility. The advantages of the CFT over other composite members are that the steel tube provides formwork for the concrete, the filled-in concrete from prolongs local buckling of the steel tube wall, the tube prevents excessive concrete "

Although a confining effect could be expected in circular CFT columns, square columns show only a small increase in axial strength due to triaxial effects, even for those with large wall thicknesses. On the other hand, the axial load-deformation behavior of columns is remarkably affected by the crosssectional shape, diameter/width-to-thickness ratio of the steel tube, and the strength of the filled concrete. The load vs. deformation relationship for circular columns showed strain-hardening or elastic perfectly plastic behavior after yielding, whereas square columns exhibited a degrading type load-deformation curve. The test strengths of circular specimens are compared with the design equation proposed by Giakoumelis and Lam[1]. "

In the past few decades, extensive work has been done[2]. Here, Schneider explains that circular CFT columns offered more axial ductility than the square or rectangular ones. In the tests for thin-walled high strength CFT columns, O’Shea and Bridge[3] observed two types of failure patterns. The columns failed either by local buckling combined with concrete crushing or by sudden failure without any local buckling. Roeder et al. stated that the bond between steel and concrete depends on three factors, including radial enlargement of wet concrete due to its pressure on steel tubes, roughness of the tube wall, and shrinkage of the concrete. The strengths have been calculated using ACI 318-99/R-99 (American Concrete Institute)[4], Eurocode 4 (EC4)[5], LRFD[6], etc. and compared by different authors. These methods are quite different in concept. "

The specimens were centered in the testing machine in order to avoid eccentricity effects. The vertical displacement was measured by a displacement transducer. Since the objective of these tests was to obtain column strengths, only displacement transducers were placed on each column to obtain test data which may be used to conduct more detailed analysis of the behavior of these columns later on by other scholars. Both surfaces of the specimens were leveled and ground smooth to remove imperfections on the surface and to maintain uniformity of the loading on the surface. A photograph showing the failure modes and test setup is given in Fig. 2 and the detail of samples is given in Table 3. "

It is also highlighted that there was no strain hardening behavior of columns contrary to RCC columns and also agree with some previous studies. Columns after 1st yielding curve kept the slope of strain descending almost linearly. Behavior of hollow and filled columns follows the similar curves as given by Johansson and Gylltoft[7,10]. "
