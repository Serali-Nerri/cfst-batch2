In this study, two specimens were prepared as ordinary concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns to be used as references to evaluate the mechanical contribution of the inner steel tube and its infill in the CFDST columns. In addition, the effect of two types of concrete: normal strength concrete (NSC) and ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC) was assessed. Besides, in order to study the influence of the steel share between the inner and outer tube, different cross-sectional configurations were considered. Since the number of experimental results available in the literature on slender CFDST columns is scarce, this work provides novel results to this research field. The different influence of the steel distribution in the response of the specimens of each series was observed, with no influence in the case of columns with ultra-high strength concrete in the outer ring. Finally, the current provisions of Eurocode 4 for the design of composite columns were assessed by means of the results of these tests, being necessary more test data to extract solid conclusions about their accuracy and reliability.

Therefore, together with the increase in the usage of CFT columns, the employment of high strength concrete (HSC) and even ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC) in this type of composite columns is becoming popular given their capability of improving the load-bearing capacity of the member with a reduced technological cost. However, the application of high strength materials results in an increment in the member slenderness due to the reduction of the strictly needed net cross-sectional area of the composite column. As a consequence, new buckling problems arise which negatively affect the structural response of the column, especially in the fire situation. "

In total, 32 columns were tested and the nominal compressive strength of the outer ring was 30 MPa. An extensive comparison with predictions given by the European code EC4-1-1 [6] was included in the publication together with a new proposal for the buckling curve.

In the fire situation, previous results [17] pointed out the convenience of setting the thick tube in the inner part of the section (thin-thick). However, at room temperature, the opposite combination (thick-thin) is more efficient, according to previous published work [17]. The importance of studying this parameter resides in confirming this fact since in the design process an overall compromise is desirable. With this aim, 6 of the specimens had a thin outer tube and a thick inner tube (thin-thick) and, oppositely, the rest of columns consist of a thick outer tube and a thin inner tube (thick-thin). In Fig. 2, the difference between these two configurations can be clearly observed and in Table 1 all the details are included. "
