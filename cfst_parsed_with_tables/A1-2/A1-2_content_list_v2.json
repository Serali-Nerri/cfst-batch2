The prevailing attitude is that the steel tube can be used for longitudinal and confining reinforcement. Confinement in a CFT is continuous, unlike the conventional spiral reinforced concrete column. Therefore, CFTs are generally considered to possess favorable characteristics for use in regions at high seismic risk. However, if the concrete core and the steel tube are loaded simultaneously, the steel tube expands more than the concrete core under moderate loads, since Poisson's ratio is higher for the steel section. This suggests that the steel tube may offer little confinement under certain conditions. "

Circular and many octagonal shapes were classified as either Type 1 or 2, while some of the octagonal and all of the square cross sections were categorized as Type 3. At high axial loads, concrete confinement was observed in the circular and many octagonal cross sections, which explained the strain-hardening characteristics for these specimens. Square tubes provided very little confinement of the concrete because the wall of the square tube resisted the concrete pressure by plate bending, instead of the membrane-type hoop stresses. Consequently, there was no axial load increase due to the triaxial compression effects for the square tubes. "

Axial load was applied to the concrete and the steel tube simultaneously for the first specimen group. The load was applied exclusively to the concrete core in the second specimen group, and the load application was similar to this in the third group except the inside tube wall was greased before casting the concrete. Results indicated that when the steel tube and the concrete core were loaded simultaneously, the tube provided no confinement until post-yield behavior. In the concrete loaded only specimens, some longitudinal stresses were noted in the steel tube even for the columns with the greased wall. Therefore, regardless of the loading condition, the wall of the steel tube appeared to be primarily in a biaxial stress state. Although test results indicated that the axial stiffness of the concrete loaded only columns were about half that of the other CFTs tested, the concrete loaded only columns obtained a greater yield and ultimate axial load capacity.

A spherical bearing was placed on the top of the CFT to ensure the applied load was concentric. Linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs) were placed inside the top and bottom end caps to monitor overall deformation. These LVDTs were also monitored in the early stages of loading to ensure that a uniform compression was imposed on the composite specimen. Axial deformations were obtained from the average of the LVDTs at each corner; however, very little variation was observed in displacement readings among the four LVDTs for any specimen. Strain gauges were placed on the exterior of the CFT to measure vertical deformations and perimeter expansion of the steel tube wall. Column load, as measured by the test machine load cell, was applied at a very slow rate such that local buckling behavior of the CFT could be carefully observed. "

The three-dimensional concrete material model available in ABAQUS was developed to simulate conditions with uniaxial strain and relatively low confining pressure. Therefore, reasonable results were expected with confinement on the order of one-fourth the uniaxial compressive stress or less. Since the experimental results suggested that little confinement was observed for the concrete core prior to yield, this material model for the concrete was considered adequate. The unconfined uniaxial stress-strain curve for the concrete used in this analysis is shown in Fig. 10. The stiffness beyond the ultimate strength of the concrete was indicative of the amount of confinement expected. This portion of the curve was adjusted according to the experimental results. The values listed in Fig. 10 represent the concrete model used for all of the finite-element analyses. "
