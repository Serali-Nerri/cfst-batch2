To explore the impact of column parameters and confinement effect three L/D ratios, two D/t ratios, two steel qualities and three concrete classes were employed. Some specimens have properties within application limits of EC4 and AISC 360-10 whereas others have properties beyond the application limits. Since new, large and efficient structures require adoption of high strength materials, it is compulsory to push the limits of design specifications. It is shown that 56 MPa and 66 MPa concretes provide very smooth and ductile load-shortening curves which imply high deformation capacity of such concrete classes. Brittle nature of 107 MPa concrete is shown by very sharp transitions from pre-peak to post-peak region and sudden discharge of loading in load-shortening curves. Additionally, 239 experimental data were collected from literature to assess EC4 and AISC 360-10 predictions within application limits and beyond application limits. Instead of focusing on a narrow region of configurations, this paper examines the performance of prediction methods on short, medium and long CFST columns. EC4 predictions indicate much better agreement with the test results. However AISC 360-10 predictions are conservative for all combinations of parameters. The application limits of EC4 can be widened to cover solutions of columns with broader properties. Confinement effect should be handled elaborately in AISC 360-10 formulations. L/D and relative slenderness are key parameters and have direct impact on column behaviour. However D/t does not have direct impact on column behaviour. "

High rise buildings [1,2], deep underground tunnels [3], bridges [4,5] and towers [6] are some examples of structures in which CFST columns are deployed as main load carrying members. High energy absorption capacity, stiffness and ductility of CFST columns motivate engineers to adopt such members in earthquake prone zones [6,7]. The steel tubing serves as a formwork for concrete core, thus construction time and costs can be reduced [7–9]. Further cost savings can be provided since CFST columns cover smaller areas on storeys compared to bare steel and reinforced concrete counterparts [1]. Also the concrete core precludes early local buckling of steel and improves the performance of entire composite cross section [5,10]. The confinement effect of circular steel tubes on concrete is the most prominent characteristic of CFST columns. With proper "

Also in the same paper, it can be observed that the studied material parameters range is not wide enough to capture underlying mechanics of CFST columns adequately.

Several researchers showed that for stub columns AISC 360-10 gives conservative predictions compared to experiments [1,5,9,12,14]. Based on experimental results of short and long columns Oliveira [15] also highlighted conservative predictions of AISC 360-10. On the other hand, capacity prediction of EC4 for stub columns was reported to be unconservative [1,15]. On the contrary, some other experimental results of stub columns were found to be very close to EC4 predictions [9,12,14]. For longer columns Oliveira [15] reported that EC4 predictions are very close to experimental results but still on unconservative side.

On the other hand, 107 MPa concrete strength is far away from the applicability boundaries of both AISC 360-10 and EC4. Steel tubes with S235 and S355 European steel qualities were used to develop different confinement effects. The above properties enabled the authors to test CFST columns with confinement factors ranging from 0.226 to 1.538 and steel contribution factors (a parameter used in EC4) from 0.185 to 0.606. The second aim of this paper is to make a general assessment of prediction methods of AISC 360-10 and EC4. After detailing experimental behaviour of 18 CFST columns with above properties, 239 additional CFST column data which were collected from literature and cover a relatively wide range of parameters were utilized to make reliable assessments of specifications. Evaluations undertaken on 257 CFST column experiments have the potential to depict the effects of column parameters on compression capacity and prediction capability of design specifications more precisely.

On the other hand, the AISC 360-10 procedure, which is based on structural steel design, allows the use of either the limit state or the allowable stress design. In addition to 18 novel test results presented in this paper, 239 CFST column test data on circular sections were collected from literature. In total, 215 test data (repetitive tests reduce the number of unique columns) which cover a relatively wide range of CFST column parameters, were employed in the design specification calculations. Table 2 presents the number of CFST columns tested in each literature study and the ranges of the physical properties of the columns. In all design specification assessments material partial safety factors were set to unity. "

It can be observed from Fig. 17 that AISC 360-10 covers relatively lower thicknesses. This is a prominent characteristic of AISC 360-10. Unlike AISC 360-10, EC4 has a strict limitation on the thickness of the tube to eliminate adverse effects of local buckling. The difference is remarkable even between compact section limit of AISC 360-10 and EC4 thickness limit. As the diameter of steel tube increases the difference between allowed thicknesses also increases. Table 4 presents the number of columns from the literature (among 215 unique specimens) which have properties beyond the application limits of design specifications. It should be noted that some specimens violate more than one design specification limit. However, such an interaction effect is not considered in this section. Performance of design specification prediction methods beyond the application limits are assessed considering each limit separately. "
