Compared to reinforced concrete columns composite columns, especially CFSTs (Concrete Filled Steel Tubes) are able to resist higher load in a post-critical region. Moreover, the destruction mechanism of the CFSTs is not so immediate. Their behaviour before destruction is plastic, ductile, which is valuable for construction safety. For "

CFST members have a lot of other advantages, which make them popular also in the European countries. CFST columns are comfortable in realisation since they do not require any formwork and additional internal reinforcement. It makes the construction process faster. Moreover, CFST columns are easy to adapt to prefabrication and to form simple standardized connections with beams and other columns. They show also a high impact resistance, which is important for bridge supports. Eventually, building facades with adopted CFST columns are of high aesthetic value. The CFST columns were intensively experimentally tested in recent years. Ahmadi et al. [1] specify 18 important experimental research programs for CFSTs conducted worldwide in the recent 50 years. Design of CFST columns was standardized in Europe 25 years ago [2]. "

Depending on the length of the span and the width of the bridge, different arrangements of CFSTs in the cross-section of an arch girder are used. Common configurations include dumbbells with two tubes closely connected and a tight cluster of tubes known as ‘multiple contiguous’. The separate tubes are connected to each other along the arch by means of other (smaller) CFSTs. "

Experimental research on 30 CFST columns was carried out. An influence of some factors on load-carrying capacity of the investigated columns was analysed. The most important factor was the bond strength between a steel tube and a concrete core. "

It was result of a triaxial state of compressive stresses occurring in a concrete core. The Fig. 7 presents also an influence of steel tube thickness of a CFST column. Higher relative load-carrying capacities were recorded for the CFST columns of a thicker steel tube. It seems that this difference was provoked by a greater ability of a thicker tube to create a triaxial state of compressive stresses in a concrete core of a CFST column. The same figure shows the influence of a way of load applying to a CFST column. Higher relative load-carrying capacities were recorded for the CFST columns loaded through the core and not through the entire cross-section. A more distinctive influence of this parameter was observed for more stub columns. "
