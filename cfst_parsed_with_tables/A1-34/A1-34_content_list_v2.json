Whether or not the current codes could accurately predict the performance of CFST members with a large crosssection remains a question when considering the influence of size effect. Although the compressive behavior of CFST columns has already been extensively studied [15–22], researches on the size effect on the compressive behavior of CFST short columns are still limited.

The applicability of Yamamoto's conclusion is doubtful for CFST columns with varied steel ratios especially for those with lower steel ratios.

Meanwhile, the size effect of the peak axial stress was affected to a certain extent by the steel ratio: the magnitude of the size effect decreased with an increase of the steel ratio. The size effect of unconfined concrete is also plotted in Fig. 11. It can be seen that the CFST specimens showed less size effect when compared with the unconfined concrete columns proposed by Sakino. This is because the confining pressure from steel tube can inhibit the development of macro-crack and reduce the size effect of concrete core. With the increase of steel ratio, the difference in size effect between CFST and unconfined concrete became more significant. Therefore, the size effect of unconfined concrete cannot be used directly when predicting the size effect of CFST columns. The influence of steel ratio on size effect of concrete core should be considered. "

Fig. 14 shows the influence of the diameter on the ratio between the load-carrying capacity calculated by the codes and that obtained from the tests. The concrete strength and the yield strength of the steel used in the formulas are the tested values, given in Tables 2 and 3. Fig. 14 illustrates that the ratio presents an increasing trend as the diameter increases, which is because the codes have not considered the size effect of the load-carrying capacity of the CFST short columns. It seems that both EC4 and GB50936 make a closer estimation for the test columns.
