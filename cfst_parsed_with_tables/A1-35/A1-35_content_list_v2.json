The experimental results indicated that the peak nominal stress decreased as the size increased, and the decrease in the nominal stress due to the size effect increased at higher ratios of diameter to thickness. At the peak load moment, an increased specimen diameter corresponded to a decreased hoop stress in the steel tube as well as a decreased concrete strength due to the confinement effect of the steel tube. When the ratio of diameter to thickness increased, the extent of reduction of the hoop stress and the confining effect of the steel tube influenced by the increasing specimen size increased. However, the vertical stress in the steel tube was increased at increased size, and increases in the ratio of diameter to thickness improved the increase degree of the vertical stress of steel tube due to the enlargement of specimen size. Hence, the vertical bearing capacity of the steel tube was affected by both the specimen size and the ratio of diameter to thickness. Based on the size effect law (SEL) proposed by Bazant, and taken the effect of the ratio of diameter to thickness into consideration, a size-dependent formula to evaluate hoop stress in the steel tube was developed. A size-related model considering situations with different ratios of diameter to thickness was established in order to estimate the bearing capacity of large-size circular concrete-filled steel tubes. The model and experimental results showed good agreement. "

Weibull [2] believed that the various defects causing strength reduction in concrete were randomly distributed and therefore proposed a statistical theory for the size-effect distribution law. Sabnis et al. [18] considered that the effect of size on concrete strength was influenced by many factors, and performed a regression analysis on compressive concrete strengths as measured by 12 researchers. They proposed a formula for calculating the compressive strength of concrete as a function of size, considering the influences of concrete strength, age, and curing conditions. Bazant et al. [19] demonstrated that energy dissipation after peak loading was related to specimen size because of the localization of strain softening damage, and thereby proposed a size-dependent model of the compressive strength of concrete based on fracture mechanics. Kim et al. [20] applied Bazant’s size effect law (SEL) for tensile strength [21] to the compressive strength of concrete and then derived a size-effect formula for the compressive strength of concrete cylinders, called the modified size effect law (MSEL) of Bazant, based on a statistical analysis of 678 experimental data including 20 specimens from Smadi et al. [22], 172 from Gonnerman [16], 26 from Blanks et al. [17], 337 from Kesler [23], and 123 from Murdock et al. [24]. Noguchi et al. [25] experimentally studied the effect of size on the cylinder compressive strength of high-strength concrete and provided two formulas for calculating the compressive strength of concrete cylinders, considering the size effect based on the statistical theory of Weibull [2] and the model of Kim et al. [26], respectively. Sakino et al. [27] determined the size effect reduction factor for the compressive strength of concrete cylinders by a regression analysis of 26 test data from Blanks et al. [17]. Yi et al. [28] experimentally investigated the compressive strengths of concrete samples with different sizes, shapes, and pouring directions, obtaining new parameters for the MSEL formula by fitting the test results. The existing results indicate that the uniaxial compressive strength of concrete is decreased as the specimen size increases; the decrease can be estimated by different theoretical methods. "

[15] concluded that increases in size caused decreases in the strength of AFRPconfined concrete at the peak bearing capacity of the specimen; the degree of decrease was increased as the confinement ratio of AFRP decreased. A formula to estimate the strength of AFRPconfined concrete considering the influence of both size and confinement ratio was established based on the SEL [21]. Elkadi et al. [32] tested concrete cylinders under triaxial compression and found that the triaxial compressive strength of concrete was decreased for increased specimen size, and then fitted the size effect formula for estimating the triaxial compressive strength based on the SEL [19]. Previous research has shown that the peak stress of confined concrete under axial compression is decreased with increasing size, and degree of decrease is increased with decreases in the confinement factor (such as the volumetric ratio of lateral steel or the confining ratio of FRP). Formulas for the peak stresses of various types of confined concrete under axial compression relating to the interaction of specimen size and confinement factor have been obtained based on the basic SEL [19,21].

While the axial compression performance is the basic performance of the column, the calculation of axial bearing capacity is also the basic index of engineering design. The research on the size effect of the compressive performance of the concretefilled steel tube (CFT) column is also helpful for the mechanism analysis of the size effect on its performance under eccentric compression, bending moment or even seismic action. Currently, the studies of the size effect on the mechanical properties of CFT columns are lack of strong scientific basis. Therefore, this paper started to investigate the size effect on CFT columns from the basic performance, namely axial compression performance. In this study, the axial bearing capacities of cylindrical CFTs with different diameters and D/t values were investigated experimentally. The diameters of the specimens were 219, 426, and "

The axial load is measured by the force sensor, while the axial deformation is the average of displacements measured by the four LVDTs. Fig. 5 shows the nominal stress–strain curves for all specimens. The nominal stress is the ratio of the axial load to the cross-sectional area of the specimen. The nominal strain is processed in two parts. In Fig. 5, nominal strain before the peak nominal stress is defined as the average of vertical strains of the steel tube as measured by the 12 gauge points arranged on the specimen; after the peak nominal stress, the nominal strain is the average of the strains obtained by the four LVDTs, where each strain measured by the LVDTs is the ratio of the measured displacement to the corresponding actual gauge length. The shift in calculation methods is used because the deformation before the peak nominal stress is small, so the strain value obtained from the strain gauges of the steel tube is more accurate than that obtained by the LVDTs. After entering the decline section, the local softening of the specimen is such that the average strain of LVDTs reflects the state of the specimen more accurately. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the initial tangent modulus of specimens with the same D/t value is essentially constant; with increased size, the peak nominal stress decreases, while the peak nominal strain varies little. Because the yield strength of the steel tube of group 2D/t88 is large, its peak nominal stress is near that of group "

In a CFT, because of the support by the core concrete, local buckling of the steel tube does not occur before the bearing capacity of the CFT is reached (as shown in Fig. 2), so the axial compression strength of the CFT is determined by the ultimate strength of the material. In addition, the steel is homogeneous while concrete is anisotropic. The size effect of the steel occurs at the microscale, but that of the concrete is in the mesoscale. In components composited from steel and concrete, the size effect of steel imperfections is small enough to be neglected generally [12,29,34]. Therefore, the initial imperfections of the empty steel tubes have little effect on the bearing capacities of CFTs with different diameters, and tests on the axial compression performance of empty steel tubes of different sizes for comparison were not performed.

The axial load bearing capacity of CFT is distributed over the steel tube and core concrete. In order to separate the bearing capacity of the core concrete from the total bearing capacity of the CFT, the biaxial stress state of the steel tube must be acquired. The vertical strain and hoop strain of the steel tube were measured by the strain gauges arranged on the steel tube during the test. Then the measured strain components of the steel tube were transformed into the vertical compressive stress and hoop tensile stress of the steel tube, using the method of Gu [40]. The method [40] obeys the Von Mises yield criterion with details found in the literature [37]. "

From known values of the equivalent stress-strain relationship and the measured data of vertical and hoop component strain in the steel tube, the vertical and hoop stress in the steel tube can be obtained by the following process: in the elastic stage of equivalent stress-strain curve, the component stress in the steel tube can be obtained by the generalized form of Hooke’s law; at the initial point in the plastic yield platform stage of the equivalent stress-strain curve, the component stress in the steel tube is determined by total deformation theory of the small elastic-plastic deformation of the Ilyushin, the equation of the Von Mises "

In recent studies on CFTs, a reduction factor is typically introduced and multiplied by the cylindrical compressive strength of concrete in order to account for the effect of size on the strength of the concrete. For example, Liang et al. [41] revised the size-effect reduction factor proposed by Sakino et al. [27] and utilized the revised factor in calculating the bearing capacity. However, the amount of test data that Sakino et al. [27] used to propose the size-effect reduction factor was quite small and unlikely to accurately reflect the effect of size on the strength of concrete. Comparing typical models, including those of Weibull [2], Noguchi et al. [25], Bazant’s SEL [21], MSEL of Kim et al. [20], and Sakino et al. [27], the MSEL model proposed by Kim et al. [20] was based on the size effect law of Bazant [21] and the relevant parameters were determined by the regression analysis of much previously collected experimental data. Therefore, the model has a comprehensive consideration of influencing factors and high credibility. Hence, the MSEL of Kim et al. [20] was utilized to consider the effect of size on the cylindrical compressive strength of concrete in this experiment, and tests on the axial compression performance of concrete cylinders of different sizes were not conducted.

When the vertical deformation is increased under increased loading, Poisson’s ratio of concrete exceeds that of the steel tube until a certain load. Then the steel tube generates hoop tensile stress when it starts to deform with the hoop expansion of the core concrete, hence providing triaxial compressive confinement to the core concrete. Meanwhile, the vertical stress of the steel tube is decreased because of the biaxial stress state of the steel. The interaction between the steel tube and core concrete causes a significant improvement in the axial compressive bearing capacity of the CFT, but also significantly complicates the calculation of the bearing capacity.
