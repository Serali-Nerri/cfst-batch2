Thirty CFST stub columns, including 15 circular specimens and 15 square specimens, were tested, and the failure pattern, load versus deformation relationship, ultimate strength and elastic modulus of the specimens were obtained and analyzed. The number of freeze–thaw cycles (from 0 to 300) and the steel ratio (cross-sectional area ratio of steel to concrete, from 0.085 to 0.176) were considered as main parameters. The test results showed that, in general, the CFST stub columns without being subjected to freezing and thawing performed a better property than those after freezing and thawing exposures. Furthermore, the larger the number of freeze–thaw cycles, the lower the ultimate strength and elastic modulus of the CFST stub columns. Based on the regression of the test data, the simplified formula for ultimate strength and elastic modulus of CFST stub columns after being exposed to freezing and thawing was proposed, and the accuracy of the formulae was evaluated by comparison between the calculated and experimental results.

At present, most attention has been devoted to the short-term mechanical properties of such composite members. However, similar to reinforced concrete members, their long-term durability is crucial as they may also suffer from chloride corrosion (Han et al., 2012) and concrete frost heaving (Wang et al., 2012). In recent years, several low-temperature failure accidents of CFST columns have happened in the north of China (Huang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2005, 2012; Yin and Yang, 2002), as summarized and presented in Table 1. It is concluded that the failure of CFST in freeze–thaw environment is caused by the combination of the icing and migration of free water in the concrete (Powers, 1945) and the low-temperature fracture of the steel. As a result, the investigation on the behavior in freeze–thaw environment is a very important issue to ensure the safety of CFST structures in cold region. To date, the structural performance of CFST members subjected to freezing and thawing has not received sufficient attention. "

Yang (2008) experimentally investigated the performance of steel tube confined concrete (STCC) and plain concrete in freeze–thaw environment, and the tests were carried out through a rapid freeze–thaw testing equipment. The results showed that the performance of all specimens was reduced after freezing and thawing exposures; however, the decrease of strength and elastic modulus of concrete in STCC was less than that of plain concrete due to the confinement effect of outer steel tube.

In present tests, the water/binder ratio of SCC is 0.325 which is close to the upper limit suggested by Aïtcin (1998) and at the same time the SCC is isolated from water in freeze–thaw environment. Furthermore, the concrete was produced in summer. Considering these facts, neither air entrainment nor antifreeze mixture of additive was added to the concrete. The slump flow test and slump test were carried out to evaluate the rheological properties of the fresh SCC, and the measured slump and slump-flow were "

The freeze–thaw tests started at the 75th and 115th days after productions of circular and square CFST stub columns, respectively. During the tests, the quality and the dynamic elastic modulus of the specimens were not measured considering the particularity of CFST, i.e. the concrete was isolated from the water due to the existence of outer steel tube. The freeze– thaw tests were stopped after completion of 300 freeze–thaw cycles. It was found that, for the steel tube of the specimens, there was neither distortion nor cracking after being exposed to freezing and thawing. It may be explained by that, compared with the practical cases listed in Table 1, the dimensions of the specimens are very small and the water to binder ratio of SCC are relatively low. The freeze–thaw cycles measured by the thermocouples within "

It can be seen that, in general, one main shear failure surface (white dashed line) is formed along 1/2 to 2/3 heights of circular specimens regardless of the number of freeze–thaw cycles, and after achieving the ultimate strength the relatively large outward deformations appear near the upper and lower ends of the shear failure surface. However, for square specimens, two or three local outward deformations along the periphery of the steel tube are formed. The maximum outward deformation of circular specimens is smaller than that of square specimens. This can be explained by that the confinement to core concrete of circular steel tube is better than that of square steel tube (Zhao et al., 2010). "

The axial shortening corresponding to the ultimate strength of specimens after freezing and thawing exposures is generally larger than that of specimens without being subjected to freezing and thawing. This can be explained by that the elastic modulus of core concrete decreases after being exposed to freezing and thawing, which results in the lowering of the compressive stiffness of the specimen. It can also be found that, the platform capacity of the specimens after the ultimate strength increases with the increasing of the steel ratio due to the enhancement of the confinement of steel tube to core concrete. Moreover, due to the better confinement to core concrete of circular steel tube compared with square steel tube, circular specimens have a slower decreasing in bearing capacity and a higher platform capacity.

                        "content": "(4) Based on the regression of the test data, the simplified formula for the ultimate strength and elastic modulus of CFST stub columns after freezing and thawing exposures is proposed considering the effect of number of freeze–thaw cycles. It may be concluded that the existing design codes under short-term loading could ensure a safe ultimate strength of CFST stub columns after being exposed to freezing and thawing, and the EC4 design equations provide an accurate prediction. The calculated elastic modulus of CFST stub columns after freezing and thawing exposures is slightly higher than the experimental results. "
